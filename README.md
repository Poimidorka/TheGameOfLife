# The Game of Life
* "Life" is played on an infinite cell field.
* Each cell has ﻿8﻿ contiguous cells.
* A creature can live in every cell.
* A creature with two or three neighbors survives the next generation, otherwise it dies of loneliness or crowding.
* In an empty cell with three neighbors, a creature in the next generation is born.
* Data entry is implemented by a list of live cells, the game goes to the backson field and displays the part of the field you need for the number of moves you need.
* '#' denotes a live cell, '.' denotes a dead cell
